#For this project, we want to find if certian drugs are in a dataset.
#The drugs we are searching for are in the master356.csv file. For each of these 356 drugs,
#we have its tradename and its active ingredient. The dataset we are searching in is DPW_expired_active.csv
#For the searching process, I use a nested loop, it will compare the tradename first and only if 
#the tradenames match, will the loop to check if the active ingredients match
